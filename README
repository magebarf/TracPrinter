Hi there!

Thanks for being interested in TracPrinter. This is really an early version of the program. The intention was to have a simple way to print tickets for a Scrum / Kanban board from a Trac installation.
To configure it, go ahead and do this:

    * Compile java code
    * edit printer.properties
    * Add your Trac-URL (eg.trac_url = http://localhost:800)
    * Add a comma-separated list of projects (trac_project = project1,project2,project3)
    * run program and type in ticket id and hit print. There you go ...

Configure printed ticket parts:

    * edit printer.properties
    * edit fields: field_header, field_description, field_footer

You may use any fieldname used in your track installation. To easily find out which fields exist in your personal installation and configuration, export a ticket as CSV and see the headline.

Default setting is

    field_header = {id}: {summary}

    field_description = {description}

    field_footer = Reporter: {reporter} - Owner: {owner}
